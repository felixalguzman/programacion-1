Declare the Club class as implementing Serializable:

public class Club implements Serializable {
    ...
}
This tells the JVM that the class can be serialized to a stream. You don't have to implement any method, since this is a marker interface.

To write your list to a file do the following:

	FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("t.tmp");
	ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);
	oos.writeObject(clubs);
	oos.close();
To read the list from a file, do the following:

	FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("t.tmp");
	ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis);
	List<Club> clubs = (List<Club>) ois.readObject();
	ois.close();
